# Introduction

Dashboard Starter Kit is a secure, web-based application designed for monitoring census and survey operations. It provides a comprehensive view of ongoing activities, featuring key indicators, scorecards, and maps to help you track performance and data quality in real-time.

As a user, you can access the Dashboard by invitation only. The dashboard manager will invite you to register by sending you a link to register (via email or other mediums). Invitation links are one-time use and will expire after a set number of hours. Once you register, you will be able to sign in and access the Dashboard.
