# Navigation

The Dashboard allows you to navigate easily between high-level overviews and detailed data views.

## Top Navigation Bar

*   **Menu**: Links to different modules (Home, Maps, Reports, Indicator pages, etc.).
*   **Indicator search**: Clicking the "Search" icon opens a command palette that allows you to search for specific indicators and navigate directly to them.
*   **Notifications**: The "Bell" icon shows alerts and messages from dashboard managers and system notifications.
*   **Language selector**: The language selector circle shows the current language and allows you to switch to another language.
*   **User profile**: Click your name/icon to access your profile settings or to log out.
