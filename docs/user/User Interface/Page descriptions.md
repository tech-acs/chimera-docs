# Page Descriptions

Understanding the common layout of the various types of pages will help you use the Dashboard more effectively.

## Indicators Pages

Indicators are usually organized into various pages dedicated to specific indicators (like Household Enumeration). These pages are selectible directly from the top nav bar and generally follow this structure:

1.  **Geographic Filter**: Located at the top, this allows you to drill down from the national level to specific counties, sub-counties, or enumeration areas. It operates in two modes: 
    *   **Drilldown mode**: Consequitively selecting hierarchically linked areas one after the other and applying the selection when you arrive at the desired level/area.
    *   **Search mode**: Directly searching and selecting the desired area by its name.
2.  **Indicators Area**: The main content area displaying various types of charts. A page can contain many indicators and depending on the current setting, the indicators will be partitioned in to pages, each containing a set number of indicators. Users can navigate between pages by using the next and previous buttons or by directly selecting the page they want to jump to.
3.  **Page navigator**: Located at the bottom, this allows you to navigate between pages. If you wish so, you can also set your preferred page size (number of indicators per page).
4.  **Page size selector**: Located at the bottom, this allows you to select the number of indicators per page. Once the user saves their preference, it will be stored in their browser and will remain until they change it again or the cookie gets cleared.

## Maps Pages

Map indicators are organized into pages. When clicking on the "Map" menu item from the top nav bar, we are presented with a menu of all the map indicator pages. Once we select one, we are taken to the map interface where we have all the indicators represented on the top left side of the screen. We can switch between the indicators by selecting them one at a time.

## Reports Pages

In the same manner as indicators and map indicators, reports are also organized into various pages dedicated to specific indicators (like Household Enumeration). These pages usually follow semantic relationship or perhaps grouping of artefacts by exercise/data source
