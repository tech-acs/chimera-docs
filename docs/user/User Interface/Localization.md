# Localization

The Dashboard is designed to operate in multiple languages to ensure accessibility for all staff members. Natively, it currently supports English (EN), French (FR), and Portuguese (PT). However, it is possible to add support for additional languages by customizing the language files.

## Changing Language

You can change the language by following these steps:

1.  Look for a **Language Selector** usually located on the right side of the top navigation bar. The icon will be a small circle with the two character international representation of the language (e.g. EN, FR, PT).
2.  Click the icon to reveal the available languages.
3.  Select your preferred language. The interface text will update immediately. If the dashboard manager has added the translations for the data related items to the dashboard, those will also update accordingly.
