# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring both your password and a code from your phone to log in.

## Enabling 2FA

1.  Go to your **User Profile** (Click your name > Profile).
2.  Scroll down to the **Two Factor Authentication** section.
3.  Click **Enable**.
4.  **Scan QR Code**: Use an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator) on your phone to scan the displayed QR code.
5.  **Verify**: Enter the code shown on your phone into the dashboard to confirm setup.
6.  **Recovery Codes**: Save the displayed recovery codes in a secure place. You will need these if you lose access to your phone.
