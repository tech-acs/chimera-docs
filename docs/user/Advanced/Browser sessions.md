2.  Scroll to the **Browser Sessions** section.
3.  You will see a list of active sessions, including:
    *   **Device/Browser Type** (e.g., Chrome on Windows).
    *   **IP Address**.
    *   **Last Active** time.

## Logging Out Other Sessions

If you see a suspicious device or forgot to log out from a public computer:

1.  Click the **Logout other browser sessions** button.
2.  Enter your password to confirm.

This will instantly invalidate all sessions except the one you are currently using.
