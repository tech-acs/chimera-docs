# Data Sources

Data Sources (or sometimes referred to as questionnaires) are the origin of your data. It us usually the representation of a census or survey exercise within the Dashboard. 

## Data Source Configuration Interface

The "Create New" data source interface allows administrators to define the identity of a data source and the technical credentials required to access it.

### Source Information Section
This section defines how the data source appears and behaves within the dashboard.

* **Name & Display Title**: The internal system name (e.g., households) and the localized public-facing title (e.g., Households).
* **Exercise Timeline**: Specific Start and End dates (formatted as MM/DD/YYYY) to define the temporal boundary of the data collection exercise.
* **Case Stats Component**: A dropdown menu to select the specific Livewire component responsible for rendering statistics for this source. The built-in default component will present interview stats in four groups (Total, Completed, Partial and Duplicate). If you have a custom Livewire component that presents the case stats in a different way, you can select it here and it will be used for this data source.
* **Visibility & Ranking**: Controls whether the source is active on the home page and its specific numerical position in the listing order.

### Connection Parameters Section
This section manages the link between the dashboard and the external database.

* **Database Driver**: A selection for the database type, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite or SQL Server.
* **Server Credentials**: Standard fields for the Host IP (e.g., 127.0.0.1), the Port (e.g., 3306), and the specific Database name.
* **Authentication**: Input fields for the Username and a masked Password field with a toggle to reveal characters for verification.
* **Status Toggle**: A final "Active" dropdown to enable or disable the connection without deleting the configuration.
