# Map Indicators

Map Indicators are specialized geospatial visualizations that represent data across different administrative levels of the hierarchy. Unlike standard charts, these indicators allow users to visualize spatial patterns and regional disparities by mapping census metrics directly onto geographic boundaries.

They are overlayed on top of the base maps and can be filtered by the same filters as the other dashboard artifacts.
