# Announcements

The Announcements module provides administrators with a direct communication channel to broadcast important updates, system notifications, or data insights to all or a specific group of dashboard users. This ensures that the entire user base—from field supervisors to national analysts—is informed of the latest changes or milestones in real-time.

## Announcements List
The Announcements interface serves as a central log and control center for broadcast messages within the platform.

### Announcements Overview
The management table displays a history of all sent communications, allowing administrators to track what was sent and when.

- **From**: Identifies the sender of the announcement (e.g., Administrator).
- **Title**: A concise subject line that summarizes the notification (e.g., "New indicators published").
- **Recipients**: Specifies the audience group receiving the message. Typically, this is set to Everyone for general updates or receipients can be targeted by role.
- **Body**: A preview of the actual message content being shared with the users.
- **Sent**: A timestamp indicating exactly when the message was broadcast (e.g., "2 seconds ago").

### Broadcasting Messages
Administrators can initiate new communications by clicking the Make Announcement button.

   - **Use Cases**:

      - Notifying users when new Indicators or Map Indicators have been published.

      - Informing stakeholders of scheduled system maintenance.

      - Highlighting specific regional data trends or census completion milestones.

## Making Announcements

The Make Announcement interface is a dedicated communication tool that allows administrators to send real-time broadcast messages to specific user groups or the entire platform. This is primarily used for system updates, data release notifications, or urgent operational alerts.

### Announcement Configuration
To send a broadcast, the following fields must be completed:

- **Title**: Enter a clear, concise subject line for the notification. This is the first text users will see (e.g., "Scheduled Maintenance" or "Q3 Data Now Available").

- **Recipients**: A dropdown menu used to define the target audience for the message.

   - **Common Scope**: Administrators typically select Everyone to ensure all active users receive the update. Or they can target users based on the roles they are assigned.

- **Message**: The main text area where the body of the announcement is composed. This field should contain the detailed information or instructions you wish to share with stakeholders.

### Sending and Visibility

- **Send Action**: Clicking the Send button immediately broadcasts the message.

- **Broadcast History**: Once sent, the message is logged in the main Announcements management table, showing the sender's identity, the recipient group, and a "time ago" timestamp (e.g., "2 seconds ago").
