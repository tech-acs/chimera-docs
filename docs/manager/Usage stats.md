# Usage stats

The Usage Stats module serves as a simplified telemetry and audit system. It captures a continuous stream of "visit" events, recording every instance a visitor navigates to a specific route within the dashboard's backend.

The interface organizes route-tracking data into three primary columns to provide a clear history of system navigation:

- **Who**: Displays the role of the user (e.g., Administrator) and their unique email address in parentheses.

- **What**: Records the specific URI or system route that was accessed. This allows for granular tracking of which tools are being utilized, such as:

- **When**: Provides the full date and high-precision timestamp for the visit (e.g., Sat, Jan 17, 2026 8:12 AM).

## Interactive Filtering in Usage Stats

The Usage Stats interface uses a dynamic "Click-to-Filter" system. Every blue link in the activity table acts as a shortcut to isolate and analyze specific parameters of the system's audit history.

### Filtering by User (Who)

Clicking on an administrator’s Email Address (displayed in blue) immediately refines the list to show only the actions taken by that specific individual.

- **Use Case**: If a configuration error is discovered, you can filter by that user to see their entire session history and understand the sequence of changes they made.

- **Security Audit**: Quickly verify if a specific account is accessing routes it shouldn't be, or monitor the activity level of a new team member.

### Filtering by Route (What)

Clicking on a specific System Path (e.g., manage/indicators or manage/report/edit) filters the log to show every time any user accessed that specific module.

- **Use Case**: If a specific report is failing, filter by that report’s edit route to see who has modified it recently.

- **Feature Adoption**: Track how often developers are using "Create" routes vs. "Edit" routes to gauge development velocity.

### Breadcrumb & Clear Filters

Once a filter is applied, the interface typically displays a "breadcrumb" or "active filter" badge at the top of the table.

- **Resetting**: Look for a "Clear Filter"(x icon) to return to the full chronological log.
