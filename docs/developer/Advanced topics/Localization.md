# Localization

Everything in the dashboard can be localized to any language. This includes the interface language and the data. 

Localizing the interface happens through language files. You can read more about it in the Laravel documentation.

Localizing data can be done right from the Management section of the dashboard. All localizable fields are displayed in a special input field
which looks like the following.

![Multilingual fields](/img/developer/advanced-topics/multilanguage-fields.png)

For example, to provide the French translations of those values, switch your language to French by selecting 'FR' from the language switcher.
FR will be displayed on the localizable fields (figure above). Then you simply enter the French translation and save. That's all!
