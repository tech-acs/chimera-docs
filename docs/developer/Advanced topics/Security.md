# Security

The Dashboard-Starter-Kit comes with an enhanced security system baked-in. Most of the typical security vulnerabilities are automatically protected against.

- Make sure you do not leave your server mis-configured. Environment should always be set to production and app debug should always be false.

- Make sure to set strong passwords. Use password generators to create cryptographically strong and random passwords.
