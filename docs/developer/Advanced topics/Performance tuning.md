# Performance tuning

Performance tuning is the systematic process of optimizing a system’s efficiency to meet specific functional requirements, such as speed, scalability, or resource consumption. It’s the bridge between a system that simply "works" and one that excels under pressure.


**The Core Pillars**
- <u>Latency</u>: Reducing the time it takes to complete a single unit of work (response time).

- <u>Throughput</u>: Increasing the total amount of work a system can handle in a given period.

- <u>Efficiency</u>: Minimizing the resources (CPU, RAM, Power) required to perform a task.

While there is no one way to do performance tuning, the following resources/articles do a good job of explaining best practices.
