# Indicator organization

Indicators can be organized into logical sets called pages. Pages, if published will show up as menu item in the top navigation bar. You can add an indicator to multiple pages.

## Creating pages

You can create pages by going to the pages sub-menu of the manage menu.

There you can create a page by providing a title, description and published status.

## Indicator ordering (per page)
By using the edit page feature, you can also control the display order of indicators included within a page.
