# Indicator organization

Indicators can be organized into logical sets called pages. Pages, if published will show up as menu items.

## Creating pages

You can create pages by going to the pages sub-menu of the manage menu.

There you can create a page by providing a title, description and published status.

## Indicator ordering (per page)
By using the edit page feature, you can also control the display order of indicators included within a page.
