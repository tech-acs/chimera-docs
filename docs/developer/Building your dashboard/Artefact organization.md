# Artefact organization

Indicators, map indicators and reports can be organized into logical sets called pages. Pages, if published will show up on an intermediary page which can then be navigated to when selected. You can add the same artefact to multiple pages.

## Creating pages

You can create pages by going to the pages sub-menu of the manage menu.

There you can create a page by providing a title, description and published status. You will also need to indicate what the page will be used for. Indicators, reports or map-indicators.

## Indicator ordering (per page)
By using the edit page feature, you can also control the display order of indicators included within a page.
