# Next steps

Hopefully, your installation has gone well. Which means the next thing you need to do is start building out your dashboard.

Please navigate to the url where your dashboard is being hosted. You should see a welcome/landing page that looks something like the following

![Landing page](/img/developer/landing.png)

Click on either the 'Get started' button or the 'Sign in' link (top right corner) and you shall be taken to a login page where you can sign in using the credentials you created during the installation via the adminify command.
