# Configuring email server

By default, emailing is disabled. 

There are various emails that can be sent by the dashboard. 

- Invitation links

- Password recovery links (forgot password), etc.

To be able to send emails from the dashboard, you will need to have a mail server prepared.

Configurations can be entered under the "Mail settings" of the "Settings" sub-menu of the Manage dashboard admin menu
