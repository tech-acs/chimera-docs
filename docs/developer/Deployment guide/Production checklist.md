# Production checklist

The Dashboard Starter Kit comes with a production-checklist command that will run through a series of checks and provides you with a pass/fail result for each.

```
php artisan chimera:production-checklist
```

These checks cover important settings, configurations and more that are critical to the proper functioning of the dashboard in production environments.

Obviously, if you have any failing checks, you should remedy them until you have all passing checks.
